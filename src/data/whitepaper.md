# JAO: Jeets Are Out

## Official White Paper
*Project by Meme Street Development*

### 1. Executive Summary

JAO (Jeets Are Out) is a Solana-based meme coin launched by Meme Street Development to celebrate diamond hands, expose paper-handed jeets, and reward holders who stay true. Backed by a seasoned dev team, JAO isn't just another token drop—it's a movement powered by community culture, memetic dominance, and built-in utility.

### 2. The Vision

Jeets are the problem. We are the solution. JAO flips the script on weak hands with:

- A culture-driven anti-jeet economy
- Holder rewards that pay out over time
- A Web3 software suite (coming Phase 2)
- A meme-native brand with real influence

### 3. Tokenomics

- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 JAO
- Initial Liquidity: Locked at launch via smart contract
- LP Platform: Raydium v4
- Buy/Sell Tax: 0% (Fair Launch)

Key Notes:
- There is no presale. This is a fair drop.
- A portion of LP will be burned on launch.
- The remaining token supply is vested in lock contracts, publicly viewable.
- All LP will eventually be fully burned.
- Dev wallets are transparent and verifiable.

### 4. Utility

On drop, JAO includes native utility:

- Dividend Rewards: Trade fee dividends distributed hourly to holders who stake their tokens
- Additional blockchain features are planned for future phases, expanding the JAO ecosystem with new DeFi functionality

### 5. Anti-Jeet Mechanisms

- Meme shame culture: We clown paper hands
- LP reserves for dip support
- Smart buys to counter dumps
- Hourly dividend rewards for stakers
- Strategic sniper protections on launch

### 6. Team

**The Wolf — Founder & Lead Dev**
Operates under the Meme Street Development banner. Known for structured fair launches, transparent vesting, and consistent meme coin growth mechanics.

Additional team members include marketing, mods, community leads, and utility devs (to be revealed post-launch).

### 7. Community First

From early Telegram raids to meme contests and daily X Spaces, JAO is built around its holders. We let the community:

- Influence meme drops
- Vote on roadmap pivots
- Run raids, contests, and content

### 8. Disclaimers

JAO is a meme coin, not a financial instrument. While utilities are being built, no guarantees are implied. Always DYOR. This project exists to flip charts and flip jeets—not your mortgage.
